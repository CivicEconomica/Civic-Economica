      <h2 class="headline">The Digital Border Within: How the UK’s Digital IDs Could Reshape the Shadow Economy</h2>
      <p class="article-meta">By Ellie Nenguke · 25/10/2025 · Politics & Economics· <span class="reading-time"> 5 min read</span></p>

      <p class="intro">
        The UK is introducing digital IDs to crack down on illegal work and strengthen borders. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called them “an enormous opportunity for the UK,” while Cabinet Office Minister Lisa Nandy said they would make a “significant dent” in illegal employment and protect lawful workers.
      </p>

      <p>
       From 2025, digital identity verification will become a central feature of the UK’s immigration and labour policy. The Home Office has intensified its crackdown on illegal working, conducting over 9,000 enforcement visits and making 6,410 arrests between July 2024 and May 2025, a 51% increase on the previous year. Digital IDs are being positioned as the next step, allowing employers to instantly confirm a worker’s right to work through secure online checks. The aim is clear: to make illegal employment impossible. Yet while the policy appears straightforward, its practical and social consequences are more complex.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UK’s informal economy, including cash-in-hand and off-the-books work, is estimated to account for 10–13% of GDP or roughly £250 billion a year. This is money circulating through construction, agriculture, care and hospitality sectors already struggling with recruitment. In hospitality, around 63% of London’s workforce are non-UK nationals. The agriculture sector relies on an estimated 45,000–55,000 seasonal workers, most of whom are migrants (. In social care, visa grants to overseas workers have fallen sharply from 34,500 in mid-2023 to around 2,000 by late 2024.
      </p>

      <p>
        If digital IDs push undocumented workers out of these roles, businesses may face labour shortages, higher costs and slower output. This could drive inflation in food, hospitality and care services, costs that ultimately fall on consumers. The informal economy has long acted as a buffer for industries facing recruitment difficulties, and limiting that flexibility risks destabilising sectors that already operate under tight margins.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        Support for the reforms comes from several Labour MPs and business groups. Jake Richards, MP for Rother Valley, leads a cross-party group of over forty Labour MPs who argue that digital IDs could “drive huge gains in public sector productivity and make it harder for those entering the country illegally to access work or public services.” Neil Carberry, Chief Executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, said the policy could “simplify hiring and create a more fluent and dynamic job market.” Ben Willmott, Head of Public Policy at the CIPD, agreed that a streamlined verification system would reduce bureaucracy for employers and strengthen workplace protections.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet other experts and industry voices warn that digital IDs may not achieve all their intended goals. Chetal Patel, Partner and Head of Immigration at Bates Wells, said that “digital IDs alone are unlikely to meaningfully move the needle on illegal working” and could have “unintended consequences” for lawful workers. Tech industry group TechUK also cautioned that countries with strong ID systems still struggle with the shadow economy, suggesting that overreliance on digital verification may not address the root causes of undocumented labour.
      </p>

      <p>
        Digital IDs assume that everyone can access and use online systems, but the UK’s digital divide tells a different story. According to Ofcom (2024), 6% of households have no internet access while 11.5 million adults lack basic digital skills. Among older people, one in six over-65s never use the internet and nearly five million struggle to use it effectively. In addition, 23% of households report difficulty affording broadband or mobile data.
      </p>

      <p>
        This reliance on digital access risks excluding those who are already marginalised, particularly in sectors such as care and hospitality where low-wage roles are often filled by older or economically disadvantaged workers. Employment could become more about digital literacy than legal entitlement, creating barriers for people who are otherwise eligible to work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Smaller businesses may struggle to implement digital verification effectively. While larger organisations can adapt more easily, smaller employers often operate on narrow profit margins and lack technical capacity, making compliance costly. Additional burdens could unintentionally push some work further underground, undermining the policy’s own goals.
      </p>

      <p>
       As the UK moves toward a digital-first verification system, the balance between efficiency, security and social equity will be critical. Digital IDs promise transparency and stronger borders, but they also risk deepening inequalities and placing pressure on sectors that already face labour shortages. In pursuing a cleaner, more traceable economy, the government must ensure that those who keep Britain running are not left behind. The success of digital IDs will depend not just on technology, but on policies that support inclusion and mitigate unintended economic and social consequences.
