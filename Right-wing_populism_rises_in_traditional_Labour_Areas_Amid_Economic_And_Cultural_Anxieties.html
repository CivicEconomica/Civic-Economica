            Right-wing populism rises in traditional Labour areas amid economic and cultural anxieties

      <p class="intro">
        As economic challenges and cultural anxieties grow, traditional political loyalties in working class communities are shifting – and the consequences are reshaping British politics
      </p>

      <p>
       Right-wing populism is gaining ground in working class communities that have historically supported the Labour Party. Labour MP Yuan Yang believes this shift is driven by a mix of economic hardship and cultural uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yang, who has served as the MP of Earley and Woodley for under a year, says voters are increasingly shifting away from the major parties towards smaller groups and independents. This reflects growing dissatisfaction and frustration with governments over the past decade.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “There’s been increasing political radicalisation,” Yang told me. “People are voting more for smaller parties or independents instead of sticking with the major parties. This reflects a loss of trust in how governments have delivered for ordinary people over decades.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Experts say economic shifts such as post-industrialisation and financialization have reshaped the British economy, further deepening the divide between educated and less-educated workers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yang explains, “Many post-industrial communities now face fewer opportunities for their children. This economic transition erodes people’s sense of belonging and pride in their communities, which fuels political polarisation.”
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When I asked about the appeal of Reform UK in her constituency, Yang said “Reform doesn’t have a real footprint here. Our area is diverse and generally highly educated, which isn’t their usual base.”
      </p>

      <p>
        However, she noted that Reform tends to attract both traditional Conservative voters and those who have not voted before, especially in other parts of the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yang also stressed the emotional toll of economic change. “We need to talk more about dignity and insecurity,” she said. “Labour’s historic focus on workers’ rights through trade unions and wage policies is important, but many workers in gig and tech sectors aren’t unionised and feel insecure.”
      </p>

      <p>
        She added Labour’s messaging needs to better connect with people feeling left behind by globalisation and liberalism. “Terms like ‘globalisation’ can sound academic and alienate many. We need to tell the economic story in a way people understand - showing how global forces affect their daily lives.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As political allegiances shift, Labour faces the challenge of reconnecting with its traditional base by addressing both economic realities and the cultural anxieties that fuel populism’s rise.
